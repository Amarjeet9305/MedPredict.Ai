- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5
- **Model Persistence**: pickle

## 📊 Dataset Information

The system uses comprehensive medical datasets containing:
- **41 Diseases**: Including common conditions like diabetes, hypertension, allergies, etc.
- **132 Symptoms**: Comprehensive symptom database for accurate predictions
- **Medical Recommendations**: Curated medications, diets, and workout plans for each disease

### Dataset Files (located in `dataset/`):
- `Training.csv`: Main training dataset with symptoms and disease labels
- `symptoms_df.csv`: Symptom database with disease mappings
- `description.csv`: Detailed disease descriptions
- `medications.csv`: Medication recommendations for each disease
- `diets.csv`: Dietary recommendations and nutrition plans
- `workout_df.csv`: Exercise and workout suggestions
- `precautions_df.csv`: Preventive measures and precautions
- `Symptom-severity.csv`: Symptom severity classifications
